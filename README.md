# Welcome to Ryan's FizzBuzz Web App!

## Steps To Run FizzBuzz
1. \[Optional\] Create a new folder to hold the project files.
2. From a terminal, navigate to this folder and run `git clone https://github.com/RyanLilla/FizzBuzzWebApp.git`
3. Change directories once more: `cd ./FizzBuzzWebApp`
4. Run the application: `dotnet run`
5. This should build and run the application -- now you can navigate to the localhost url in your browser that is printed to the window (e.g., `http://localhost:5022`)
6. Voil√†! FizzBuzz!
